# BoulderProject

BoulderProject provides a way for climbers to track their progression in the gym.

In the main view, saved routes are displayed in a list. Users can tap on each route to show a detail view with less image cropping and a full description. In the detail view, users can edit the route, or mark it as completed. Tapping on the detail view returns the user to the preview.

Routes are saved persistantly using CoreData. On install, BoulderProject pre-loads default colors and grades for routes. Users must add their own gyms when they create a new route. In addition to the defaults, users can also add their own custon colors and grades. Routes can be deleted by sliding them to the left of the screen.
